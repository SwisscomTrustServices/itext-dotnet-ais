Usage: .\CLI.exe [OPTIONS]

Options:

    -input [FILE]                                       - Source PDF file to sign. You can use this parameter several times, to sign multiple
                                                          documents at once. Using multiple inputs forces the usage of suffix (see below) as it is
                                                          difficult to give both the input and the output files as parameters.

    -output [FILE]                                      - Output PDF file, where the signed document should be written. This parameter can be
                                                          used only when one single input is given. For more than one input, use suffix.

    -suffix [SUFFIX]                                    - Suffix for output file(s), composed using the input file plus the suffix, as alternative to
                                                          specifying the output file entirely. Default is "signed-#time", where "#time" is replaced
                                                          with current time (hhMMss).

    -type [static|ondemand|ondemand-stepup|timestamp]   - The type of signature to create

    -config [PROPERTIES FILE]                           - The properties file that provides the extra configuration parameters. A sample configuration is provided in config.json

    -help                                               - This help text

    -v                                                  - Be verbose. Sets logging to DEBUG. By default logging is set to INFO 


Sample use cases:
    1. Edit the config.json file accordingly
    2. > .\CLI.exe -type timestamp -config config.json -input fileIn.pdf -output fileOut.pdf
    3. > .\CLI.exe -type timestamp -config config.json -input file1.pdf -input file2.pdf -input file3.pdf -v
